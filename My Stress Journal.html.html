            <font size="3.5" color="#3E3E43"><p>
                Stress To Me Means A State Of Mental Or Emotional Disbalance In Life, And Mostly Everyone Face This Condition Time To Time. 
                Stress Is The Response My Mind And Body Gives To My Emotions, Pressure, Triggers And Fear. This Journal Represents The 
                Tracking Of My Stress Over The Week.

			<h2>Monday</h2>
		<font size="3.5" color="#3E3E43"><p>Felt Stress About The Project & Presentation Of Our DFW Project As The Tone Notes Of 
            Our Arduino Mini Piano Project Were Not Working Quite Well. And We Had To Give Presentation To Kunal Sir. We Tried To 
            Fix The Wiring Of The Project As It Was Also Loose And Complex Looking. We Had Completed Our Project Almost Many Weeks 
            Ago And Instructed Others On How To Make Projects, But Now Our Own Project Looks Too Simple And Basic Compared To Others 
            Arduino Projects, So That's Also A Good Problem To Think Over - Now What To Do With? Should We Change Our Whole Project? 
            Leave It As It Is? Or Steal Or Break Others’ Ideas? (Of Course, We Used To Leave Our DFW Project As It Is, Because Other 
            Plans Were Not Good.)</p></font>

			<h2>Tuesday</h2>
		<font size="3.5" color="#3E3E43"><p>Extremely Stressful Day Because Of DFW Project Presentation. Finally, We Solved The Tone 
            Notes Frequency Problem, But As Our Team Had To Go Third, We Played It Multiple Times To Check If It's Working Well Or Not. 
            At Some Point, I Was Thinking If It's Okay To Play It This Much Before Presentation? What If It Stops Working Due To Too 
            Many Plays? And One Of My Team Mate Was Continuously Playing The Ambulance Siren On The Project, Saying We've Invented 
            A New Tone For Ambulance Siren And Ventilator Machine (And I Don't Know Why, But At Some Points Even I Was Thinking That Yeah, 
            It's Correct It Was Sounding Exactly Like A Heart Monitoring Machine When Someone Passed Out And It Shows A Straight Line Of 
            Beeeeepppppppppppppppppp..............), But Still, It Worked Well And We Were Happy. Then Suddenly, Prince Sir Announced PPS 
            Manual Submission & Viva For The Next Day, And No One Had Prepared For It Or Completed The Manual Of PPS. Even Many People From 
            The Hostel Had To Cancel Their Tomorrow’s Tickets For Home Due To This Sudden Viva. And All Of Us Were Writing The Manual 
            Practicals Of PPS.
		</p></font>

			<h2>Wednesday</h2>
		<font size="3.5" color="#3E3E43"><p>Today Was Also Stressful But Not As Much As Yesterday. Most Of Us, Including Me, Were Feeling 
            Frustrated Due To The Sudden PPS Viva, And We Came To Know In The Morning Just A Few Hours Before College That We Had PPS 
            Practicals Too. No One Had Prepared Even For The Viva Because Of The PPS Manual Assignment, Which Made Me Stay Up Till Late Night 
            To Complete. It Was Now My Third Day Of Staying Up Late. I Was Thinking To Prepare For Viva In The Morning, But Had To Change 
            The Plan For Practicals. When We Went To Give Our Practicals For C Programming, Sir Informed Us To Write Code In Linux And, WOW, 
            Most Of Us Forgot The C Commands In Linux OS, But At Least Survived The Practicals By Questioning Sir And Others. Then After Lunch, 
            I Just Went For Viva Without Any Preparation As I Was Feeling Tired And In No Mood To Read Anything.
		</p></font>
			<h2>Thursday</h2>
		<font size="3.5" color="#3E3E43"><p>Okay So Today Was Good Compared To The Other Days Of This Week. But I Was Feeling A Little Not Good, 
            Sad, And Empty As All Of My Friends (CoCo, Rhyme & Henny) Went Out To A Function And Home For Some Days, And Now It's Quite Boring 
            To Survive The Whole Day Without Any Of Them. I Don't Know Why I Refused To Go With Them As Henny Told Me To Come Along With Them 
            For Some Days, But Because Of This GTU Fighter I've To Stay Here. Still Somehow The Day Went By Because Of My Maths GTU Fighters.
		</p></font>
			<h2>Friday</h2>
		<font size="3.5" color="#3E3E43"><p>Normal Day Without Much Tension Or Fear Of Any Deadline Or Task. But A Bit Exhausted Due To Maths 
            GTU Fighter And Too Many Clothes To Wash And Cleaning My Desk At Hostel. Sometimes It Feels Like I'm A House Worker At Both Sides, 
            At My Home And Here Too (Guess What, I'm A Free Worker At My House And Pay Fees To Stay Here!!!). And At The End Of The Day We've 
            To Eat The World's Most Dangerous Meal To Check Our Limits Of Surviving. At Least Today Is Friday, And Dinner Is Bearable For Me 
            On This Day.</p></font>
			<h2>Saturday</h2>
		<font size="3.5" color="#3E3E43"><p>Relaxed Day Without Any Other Work. Only Tried To Complete All 8 Tests In Maths Given By Rashik Sir 
            For All GTU Fighters. But Of Course, Failed To Complete All Tests. Now Still, For One Last Time, I Have To Go For Fighters On Monday. 
            Otherwise, Quite Peaceful Day Of The Week. No.!!! Wait, Today Is Saturday And The Dinner Is Dal-Bati. Now Our Hostel Will See If 
            We Can Survive At Unknown, Anonymous, And Dangerous Island Or Forest Without Any Food Just By Eating Stones??? As Their Bati Is 
            No Less Than Any Stone. We Can Attack On Terrorists With These Stones I Mean Batis, Ever If Someone Tries To Attack Our College Or 
            Hostel. We Know That They Will Definitely Lose Their Life Against Our Saturday Food, Or At Least Will Surrender To Save Themselves. 
            More Than Half The Hostel Takes Fast On Dinner Or Cooks Something By Themselves Rather Than Come To Eat At Night.
		</p></font>
			<h2>Sunday</h2>
		<font size="3.5" color="#3E3E43"><p>RK Doesn't Like To See Me Relax For Too Long. Now Again There Are Tasks To Handle For 
			The New Week. First Of All, The Whole Class's Tension Is BEE. Everyone Has To Complete The BEE Assignment To Submit It On 
			Monday, And As Always, No One Has Completed It. So Again, Have To Live Like A Night Owl Or A Night Guard To Save The Hostel 
			From Thieves Or Ghosts (We Are Even Stealing Their Jobs Too By Staying Up All Night). Then There Is ETC Viva + Submission 
			On Tuesday, And No One Knows What Type Of Questions Or Interview Pooja Ma'am Is Going To Take?? That Too With Formal Attire, 
			Which Is Another Type Of Stress For People Around Me, As Most Of Them Don’t Have Many Formals. Thankfully, It’s Not A Stress 
			For Me At Least, As More Than Half Of My Wardrobe Is Filled With Formals.

        <section id="Conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <h3>What I've Learned About Myself</h3>
            <p>Through Maintaining This Stress Journal, I've Gained Valuable Insights About My Emotional Patterns And Effective Coping 
            Mechanisms. I Come To Know About Many Aspects Of My Stress And There Are So Many Reasons Causing Stress To Me. But On 
            Other Hand There Are Too Many Solutions Too For Managing My Stress, Anger, Anxiety And Other Low Feelings. I Never 
            Acknowledged That How Some Of My Small Habits Like Watching Sky, Playing Flute, Reading Book Or Talking To My Friends 
            Helps Me So Much To Enjoy And Live My Life Better. While Knowing About My Stress And Its Triggers And Factors I Also See 
            That Even My "Practical Stress Journal Assignment" Is Also A Good Source Of Stress For Me From Past 2 Weeks. As It's 
            Been Little Critical And Too Thoughtful To Manage By Oneself And Do Everything Correctly To Make A Webpage. But 
            Gradually Day By Day When I'm Making It Further And Adding Code For Next Step It Is Becoming Easy And Beautiful Work. 
            I Never Imagined In My Life That I Can Make Something Like This By My Knowledge Of HTML. I Learned About CSS By This 
            Assignment And Know How To Use Both HTML & CSS Together To Create Something Really Amazing.</p>

            <h3>Future Changes</h3>
            <p>Moving Forward, I Plan To Use Some Stress-Managing Techniques To Reduce It And Improve My Routine By Adding My Hobbies 
            To Daily Tasks. I Will Also Be Mindful Of The Early Signs Of Stress So I Can Stop It From Rising In My Mind. I Will 
            Try To Manage My Time And Screen Time To Reduce Their Negative Impact On Me. I'll Try My Best Not To Let My Stress 
            Control My Mind, But To Learn How To Stop Worrying Over Small Things And How To Divert Myself From Stress. I've Also 
            Learned The Importance Of Seeking Support Instead Of Trying To Handle Everything Alone.
